### Number of the Day Application

The purpose of this code is to host a web server  
that will provide those using the code with a different  
number every day. It is almost like a random number generator  
the difference is that the random number is dependant on the  
date the application was opened.
  
## How to use

# Dependencies 
the program is written in Go and so you will need to download  
Go to be able to use it.

Download Go [Here](https://go.dev/dl/)

When you have Go downloaded, the program is not too difficult to start.
Navigate to the src folder and in the terminal run "go run app.go"

After the server starts open your favorite brower and navigate to

http://localhost:8081/

Congrats, you are now able to guess the number of the day.
